# Examples

This folder is reserved for sample outputs and walkthroughs. After running `python app/main.py`,
you will find SVG visualizations inside the `figures/` directory:

- `confusion_matrix.svg`
- `feature_importance.svg`
- `pca_scatter.svg`

Feel free to copy them here when sharing results or embedding in docs.
